## apiDoc Tree Sitter Parser

Thank you Atom, very cool!

Created for the [language-apidoc](https://github.com/almic/language-apidoc) package which I manage. Because Atom are being very awesome I had to spend a week figuring out this new sweet parsing method after I had already spent so long writing regex patterns for it, because for some reason they decided to make the new method NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE for injection-based syntaxes.

I'm not mad, just... well... disappointed.
